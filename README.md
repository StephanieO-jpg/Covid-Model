- On 31 December 2019, WHO was alerted to several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. The virus did not match any other known virus. This raised concern because when a virus is new, we do not know how it affects people.
- Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus (more specifically, a coronavirus) identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, China. Early on, many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan, China reportedly had some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. However, a growing number of patients reportedly have not had exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread is occurring. At this time, itâ€™s unclear how easily or sustainably this virus is spreading between people

What is Covid19?

COVID-19(Corona Virus, Discovered in 2019) is a respiratory illness caused by a new virus. Symptoms include fever, coughing, sore throat and shortness of breath. The virus can spread from person to person, but good hygiene can prevent infection.

# Question

Objective of this notebook is to study COVID-19 outbreak with the help of some basic visualizations techniques. Comparison of China where the COVID-19 originally originated from with the Rest of the World. Perform predictions and Time Series forecasting in order to study the impact and spread of the COVID-19 in coming days

# Goal
To create a forecasting model, to make predictions on fatalities, recoveries and confirmed cases over this coming year.

# Data 
This data is curated and updated on a dashboard by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at the John Hopkins University (link found here : https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6 ). The Data is extracted from the google sheets associated and made available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset). The data is also available as csv files in the John Hopkins University Repository (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
